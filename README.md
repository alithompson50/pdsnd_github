Bikeshare Project

### Description
This project imports data from the bike share systems of New York City, Chicago, and Washington providing an interactive experience for the user where they can choose to filter the data by month and day of the week. After the filters are chosen the program provides descriptive statistics and also gives the user the choice to view raw data.

### Credits
*I used the channel provided by Udacity to work with the mentor to get advice and support throughout this project. On lines 88 through 96 in the bikeshare.py I needed to only return one value and my code was not with just value_counts(), so I looked on the channel and Raheel the mentor, had said to use idxmax() so I tried that and it worked to only return the first value. On line 166 in the bikeshare.py file, my code was returning the year with .0 at the end so Raheel told me to use {:.0f} to format the year correctly. On line 120 in the bikshare.py file Raheel had told another student on the channel to use loc for this function so I tried that and it worked in getting the correct output.*
